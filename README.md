Font from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lilita+One?category=Display

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

##JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
########FanClub Sign up
1.When trying to submit a empty form, error msg will be shown
2. When email does not have @ or . an error message will be shown
3. When keying in password, if password length is less than 8 there will be a error message
4.if password does not match, error message will appear

the different pages will change and fit different sizes so that there is no issues.





You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
